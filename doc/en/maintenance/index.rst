In this section we're going to learn how to compile, install and update the platform. 

All code you need it's on the `github repository <https://github.com/geosolutions-it/crop-information-portal>`_. Please follow the instructions in the link before continue with this training.

Also, you need a version of this products:

* GeoStore
* Http-proxy
* GeoServer

and more infraestructure applications:

* Apache Tomcat 6.0.37
* Apache Httpd (Web server)
* PostgreSQL - PostGIS

On the actual deployment all this stuff is already installed and configured, but if you want to install the application in a new server, you must install it and configure it.
