    WMS panel

The panel provides a few additional controls as follows:

* The top drop down box provides a list of preconfigured servers from which layers can be obtained
* The central grid provide information about the layers served by the server selected in the drop down box
* We have an ``Add a New Server`` button in order to allow us to add an additional server (WMS or WMTS) 
* We have the button in the bottom right corner to either add to the current map the selected layer from the selected server or to close the panel itself
* We also have the capabilities to filter the layersâ€™ grid via a text box at the bottom left corner. The  ``Clear Filter`` button can be used to remove any filtering
